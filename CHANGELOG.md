## [0.19.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.18.5...v0.19.0) - 2025-08-22

### Changed

- **Breaking** the `header` field is replaced with `columnDescriptors` in `DataFrame` ([#256](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/256)). It is an array of objects with the following properties:
  - `name`: the column name.
  - `sortable`: whether the column is sortable (default: `false`).
  - `metadata`: optional metadata for the column, which can be used to store additional information about the column. Not used by HighTable.
- **Breaking** the `getCell`, `getRowNumber` and `fetch` methods must handle and validate (using `validateOrderBy` for example) the optional `orderBy` parameter ([#254](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/254)).
- **Breaking** make `eventTarget` and `fetch` fields optional in `DataFrame` ([#254](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/254)).
- **Breaking** remove the intermediary `UnsortableDataFrame` and `SortableDataFrame` types ([#254](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/254)).
- **Breaking** remove the `createStaticFetch` helper function, which is not needed anymore now that `fetch` is optional ([#254](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/254)).
- **Breaking** remove the `sortable` field in `columnConfiguration` prop ([#256](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/256)).
- **Breaking** make `DataFrame` generic to pass the optional `.metadata` and `.columnDescriptors[].metadata` types ([#256](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/256)).
- validate the row and column in the fetch method within sortableDataFrame ([#253](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/253)).

### Fixed

- preserve the metadata when sorting or filtering a dataframe ([#251](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/251)).

## [0.18.4](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.18.3...v0.18.4) - 2025-08-15

### Added

- hide columns (and show hidden columns) from the column header menu ([#244](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/244)).
- new option prop, `renderCellContent`, to customize cells rendering ([#236](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/236)).
- new option prop, `onColumnsVisibilityChange`, to get the list of hidden columns ([#246](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/246)).

### Fixed

- fix columns width when a column only contains undefined values ([#245](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/245)).
- only resize the columns on left click ([#247](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/247)).

### Refactored

- updated dev dependencies ([#248](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/248)).

## [0.18.3](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.18.2...v0.18.3) - 2025-08-06

### Added

- minWidth to the column configuration option to override global min width ([#238](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/238)).

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.17.2...v0.18.0) - 2025-07-29

### Changed

- **Breaking** change the DataFrame interface.
  - the previous Dataframe interface is now called `DataFrameV1`, and a conversion function `convertV1ToDataFrame` is provided to convert it to the new format.
  - the functions `rowCache` and `getGetColumn` are deprecated and removed.
  - the functions `asyncRows`, `awaitRow`, `awaitRows`, `resolvableRow`, `resolvablePromise`, `wrapPromise`, and `wrapResolved`, and the types `ResolvablePromise`, `AsyncRow`, `Cells`, `PartialRow`, `ResolvableRow`, `Row` are deprecated, but still provided.
  - the DataFrame interface is now the union of `UnsortableDataFrame` and `SortableDataFrame`. It is recommended to use them to be explicit about the support of sorting.
- the DataFrame interface now relies on the `fetch` method that must be called to fill the cache, and the `getCell` and `getRowNumber` methods that give synchronous access to the cached data. It means that the new DataFrame is not row oriented anymore and handle the data at the cell level. It also provides an `eventTarget` field to listen to the `resolve` events sent when the data is fetched. Also note that the `fetch` method accepts an `AbortSignal` option to abort a fetch request. See the [README](README.md) for more details.
- new functions and types are provided:
  - `filterDataFrame` to derive a new DataFrame using a filter function.
  - `createEventTarget` to create an event target that can be used in a DataFrame.
  - `DataFrameEvents`, `CustomEventTarget` and `TypedCustomEvent` to handle custom events in a DataFrame.

### Fixed

- fix an error when clicking "select all" on an empty dataframe ([#216](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/216)).
- ensure the row numbers column has always a minimum width, even for an empty dataframe ([#216](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/216)).

## [0.17.2](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.17.1...v0.17.2) - 2025-06-17

### Added

- Added sortable option to the columnConfiguration property
  - Currently disable only, sortable: true will be ignored

## [0.17.1](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.17.0...v0.17.1) - 2025-06-13

### Added

- Added external facing columnConfiguration property to HighTable component
  - Format is { [columnName]: { ...configuration } }
  - Currently only supports one property, headerComponent which allows overriding the header cell with a custom React component

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0) - 2025-06-04

### Changed

- **Breaking** change the algorithm to compute the column widths ([#197](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/197), [#201](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/201)):
  - no column can be narrower than minWidth (hardcoded to 50px).
  - a column resized manually (with mouse or keyboard), including autoresize, is highlighted visually with a blue dot. It's called a "fixed width".
  - the fixed widths are saved in local storage, and restored when the table is mounted.
  - an autoresized column can be unconstrained by the same action as autoresizing (double-click or space or enter on the resizer).
  - when resizing a column, the other columns are let unchanged.
  - on mount or table resize, the free columns are resized to fill the available space, shrinking or growing to fit the table width.
  - the localstorage key now has the syntax `${cacheKey}:column:states` instead of `${cacheKey}:columns:widths`, to invalidate the existing entries, since the format has changed.
- **Breaking** change the role (hence the CSS selector) of the resizer from `separator` to `spinbutton` ([#202](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/202)).
- add support for ArrowUp, ArrowDown, PageUp, PageDown and Home in the column resizer ([#202](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/202)).
- use border-box sizing to compute the width of the columns ([#196](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/196)).

### Refactored

- updated dev dependencies ([#204](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/204)).

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.15.6...v0.16.0) - 2025-05-23

### Added

### Changed

- **Breaking** when the selection is expanded (shift+click), the new anchor is the clicked cell (before, anchor was unchanged) ([#186](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/186)).
- **Breaking** when the selection is expanded (shift+click), if the clicked cell is the anchor, the row is toggled (before, it was a no-op) ([#186](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/186)).
- **Breaking** remove the ability to navigate with Space / Shift+Space, which was a shortcut for PageUp/PageDown ([#176](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/176)).
- Faster resolvablePromise by skipping wrapPromise ([#175](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/175)).
- Restore color to the checkboxes when actionable ([#189](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/189)).
- Change sort arrows style and an icon (two arrows) when unsorted ([#193](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/193)).

### Fixed

### Refactored

- add `asyncRows` tests ([fb4438b](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/commit/fb4438b8385ae61ff5bd9c5c8ee24b5342c79b4b)).

- **Breaking** `wrapPromise<T>` now ONLY accepts an argument of type `Promise<T>`, and no longer accepts an argument of type `T`. In those cases use `wrapResolved<T>`

## [0.13.5](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.13.4...v0.13.5) - 2025-04-03

### Fixed

- fix scroll jitter ([#100](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/100)).

## [0.13.4](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.13.3...v0.13.4) - 2025-04-02

### Fixed

- fix column widths ([#95](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/95), [#96](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/96)).

## [0.13.3](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.13.2...v0.13.3) - 2025-04-01

- update development dependencies ([#86](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/86)).

## [0.13.1](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.13.0...v0.13.1) - 2025-03-27

### Changed

- Export the default function to stringify cell values as `stringify`, and align the code with the same function in `hyperparam`. The only change is that arrays are now indented ([#82](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/82)).

### Fixed

- Fix the CSS stacking order to prevent cell placeholders to float above the row headers ([#81](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/81)).

### Refactored

- Use the variable name `styles` instead of `classes` for CSS module classes ([#83](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/83)).

### Added

- add a `className` prop to the `HighTable` component ([#74](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/74)).
- add a `styled` prop to the `HighTable` component to apply or disable the default theme ([#75](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/75)).

### Changed

- **Breaking** the `OrderBy` type is now an array of column sorts: `{ column: string; direction: 'ascending' | 'descending' }[]`. If empty, the data is not sorted. If it contains one element, the data is sorted along the column, in the specified direction. If it contains multiple elements, the first column is used to sort, then the second one is used to handle the ties, and so on ([#67](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/67), [#68](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/68), [#69](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/69)).
- **Breaking** the `orderBy` property in `rows` method uses the new `OrderBy` type. If `data.sortable` is `true`, the data frame is able to sort along the columns as described above.
- **Breaking** the `orderBy` property in `HighTable` and `TableHeader` uses the new `OrderBy` type.
- **Breaking** the `onOrderByChange` property in `HighTable` and `TableHeader` that takes the new `OrderBy` argument.
- **Breaking** click on a column header has a new behavior: it sorts along that column first, and uses the other columns of `orderBy` as secondary sorts. If the column was already the first column, it follows the cycle ascending -> descending -> no sort ([#69](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/69)).
- **Breaking** the top left cell of the table now handles the checkbox to select all the rows (and the absolutely positioned div is removed). It can affect overriden CSS ([#70](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/70)).
- **Breaking** all CSS classes have been removed. Use the `className` prop to apply custom styles ([#75](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/75)).
- changed the format of the keys in local storage when storing the column widths. Each column now has its own key ([#71](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/71)).
- split the CSS styles into mandatory functional styles and optional theme styles ([#75](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/75)).
- the selection checkboxes are now disabled while the data is being loaded ([#77](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/77)).
- sortableDataFrame now supports sorting along multiple columns ([#69](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/69)).

### Refactored

- Use small components instead of defining all the elements in HighTable and TableHeader ([#70](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/70)).
- Structure the code files in directories: components/, hooks/, utils/ and helpers/ ([#70](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/70)).
- Specify CSS as a CSS module ([#74](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/74), [#75](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/75)).

## [0.12.1](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1) - 2025-03-07

### Refactored

- upgraded dependencies.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0) - 2025-03-07

### Refactored

- Build the library with Vite instead of Rollup ([#63](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/63)).
- Harmonize the ESLint and Typescript rules with the other hyparam projects ([#63](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/63)).

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) - 2025-02-27

### Added

- expose the `stringify` function as a prop of the `HighTable` component ([ef4a642](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/commit/ef4a642c0c8dc5478abb675e200e2bab2c274518)).
- export the new function `getGetColumn()` and let the data frame provide its own `getColumn()` function. `getColumn({column, start, end}): any[]` let fetch the data of an individual column ([#53](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/53)).

### Changed

- **Breaking** the `rows` method in a data frame now takes a single object argument with the following properties: `start`, `end` and `orderBy` ([#52](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/52)).
- **Breaking** the rows selection now refers to the position in the data source, not in the table. It is therefore independent of the sort ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).
- **Breaking** the minimal supported React version is now 18.3.1 ([ef4a642](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/commit/ef4a642c0c8dc5478abb675e200e2bab2c274518)).
- **Breaking** for accessibility, the top-left cell of the table is now a `<td>` element instead of a `<th>` element ([#57](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/57)).
- changed colors in CSS.
- for accessibility, increased the font size of the cell numbers and made it proportional to the default user font size ([#57](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/57) and [#59](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/59)).

### Refactored

- updated the link to the demo in the README ([ef4a642](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/commit/ef4a642c0c8dc5478abb675e200e2bab2c274518)).
- removed call to `act()` in tests where not required ([#54](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/54)).
- small code reorganization ([#56](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/56)).
- simplify the internal state management ([#55](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/55) and [#58](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/58)).

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.9.2...v0.10.0) - 2025-02-11

### Changed

- **Breaking** only support `AsyncRow[]` (instead of `AsyncRow[] | Promise<Row[]>`) as the return type of the `rows` function in the `DataFrame` object ([#36](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/36)).
- **Breaking** changed the format of rows. Instead of `Record<string, any>` with an optional `__index__` field, rows are now `Row` objects with a mandatory index: `{index: number, cells: Record<string, any>[]}` ([#36](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/36)).
- **Breaking** revert to being compatible only with React 18 ([#47](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/47)).

### Fixed

- use the minimal supported React version (18.2.0) to build the package ([#41](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/41)).

### Refactored

- use `Promise.all` to fail fast when fetching the cells ([#37](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/37)).
- upgrade the dev dependencies ([#42](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/42)).
- move the code related to promises and rows to separate files ([#43](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/43) and [#44](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/44)).
- decouple scroll and data fetch ([#45](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/45)).
- use useCallback to avoid creating functions on each rendering ([#46](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/46)).
- add this CHANGELOG file ([#39](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/39) and [#40](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/40)).
- add doc about how to create a dataframe in the README ([#48](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/48)).

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2) - 2025-01-30 [DEPRECATED]

The package was [deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hightable/v/0.9.2) because it was published with React 19 instead of the minimal one (18.2.0).

### Changed

- add compatibility with React > 18 ([#35](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/35)).

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1) - 2025-01-22

### Added

- add `orderBy`, `onOrderByChange`, `selection` and `onSelectionChange` props to `HighTable` ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)). Their behavior is described in the README:

  ```typescript
  orderBy?: OrderBy; // order by column (if defined, the component order is controlled by the parent)
  onOrderByChange?: (orderBy: OrderBy) => void; // orderBy change handler
  selection?: Selection; // selection state (if defined, the component selection is controlled by the parent)
  onSelectionChange?: (selection: Selection) => void; // selection change handler
  ```

### Changed

- **Breaking** in CSS: use the new `show-corner-selection` class, and allow showing selected rows without the parent `selectable` class ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)).
- **Breaking** the `orderBy` prop in `TableHeader` is now an `OrderBy` object, not a string ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)).
- **Breaking** the `setOrderBy` prop in `TableHeader` is renamed to `onOrderByChange` and takes an `OrderBy` argument instead of a string ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)).
- **Breaking** the `Selection` type is now an object containing the ranges of selected rows and the optional anchor. The previous definition of `Selection` is now called `Ranges` ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)).
- export `State`, `Action` and `reducer` ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)) (we should revert as they are internal-only!).

### Removed

- **Breaking** the `tableControl` and `selectable` props have been removed from `HighTable` ([#22](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/22)). Use the new props instead to control the selection and order of the table.

### Fixed

- add missing React Hooks dependencies to `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks ([#28](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/28)).

### Refactored

- use `useCallback` for props of `TableHeader` to avoid unnecessary re-renders ([#28](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/28)).
- check React Hooks dependencies with eslint ([#28](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/28)).
- add roles to the HTML elements ([#28](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/28)) to help screen readers and to test with testing-library based on semantics as recommended.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0) - 2025-01-15

### Changed

- **Breaking** the rows selection refers to the position in the table, not in the data source. It is therefore dependent on the sort ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).
- show the "data index", ie the position of the row in the data source, in case of error in the title attribute. If not available, don't show any row number ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).

### Fixed

- fix an off-by-one error for the rows selection ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).

### Refactored

- change data and table index variable names for clarity ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).
- add comments and doc strings ([#34](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/pull/34)).
